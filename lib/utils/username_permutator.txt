# The only characters you can use are uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and the underscore character(_).
# Here are a more few tips to keep in mind when choosing a Twitter username: A good username is the same, or similar to, your own name.

#
#
# Here are the possible reasons why you would be unable to claim a username that seems available:
#
# Usernames containing the words Twitter or Admin cannot be claimed. No account names can contain Twitter or Admin unless they are official Twitter accounts.
# Your username cannot be longer than 15 characters. Your name can be longer (50 characters) or shorter than 4 characters, but usernames are kept shorter for the sake of ease.
# A username can only contain alphanumeric characters (letters A-Z, numbers 0-9) with the exception of underscores, as noted above. Check to make sure your desired username doesn't contain any symbols, dashes, or spaces.
# The username may be claimed by a suspended or deactivated account. Suspended and deactivated usernames are not immediately available for use, so youâ€™ll need to select a different username.
